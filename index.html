                  This is the app that I built 3 months into my time at Nashville Software School. It is far more than what the class required, but I am happy that I was so ambitious. The amount of logic required to make this work, while simultaneously learning new tools, proved to be both fun and challenging. This app uses the web audio api for a solid performance during playback. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript within React. JSON was used for the database.

                  Three weeks into my time at Nashville Software School, two other students and myself were pulled aside and asked if we would like to tackle a group project. I had worked ahead of the class an entire chapter, so I suspect that the other two were in similar situations. This project proved to be the biggest challenge to date. We had never used an API before, so we had a lot of learning to do. The most valuable skills I acquired during this experience have to be using Github and working with a fully remote team through Zoom.

                  I created this artist page when I was still 100% self taught. I had previously done a lot of coding in python, but I had never done any front end web development. It is incredibly simple. Just HTML and CSS with a splash of JS for the navbar animation. I absolutely loved making this and learned so much in the process.

              <p>
                Growing up as a musician, I always wanted to advance my skills
                and expand my vocabulary on my instrument. It is this same
                approach that I bring to software development. The more you
                practice and learn, the easier it is to express yourself
                creatively. As an artistic person, it bothers me when I can see
                the end vision of a project, but do not have the necessary
                skills to implement said project. I am determined to remove as
                many of these barriers as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my developer career path on my own, and for almost a
                year, I absorbed everything I could. I was able to attain a firm
                grasp on programming fundamentals and was quickly solving more
                complex problems. Before the year was over, I made the decision
                to attend Nashville Software School's full-stack web development
                course. My goal was to learn industry best-practices and become
                career ready.
